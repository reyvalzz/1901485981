This repositories contains about python script from the topic of my thesis,
the goal is to make it easier for me to apply for cybersecurity jobs that require python scripting skills,
as well as proof during technical interviews that I am capable, if I get a python scripting assignment.

The essence of the thesis title **APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING IN DETECTING SQLI ATTACK DATA PACKAGES** are:
Manage data packets from WAF Modsecurity logs mounted in front of DVWA (Modsecurity and DVWA reside in Apache Webserver)
The logs are in the modsec log format, containing HTTP packets.
There are 2 logs:
1. Log which is the normal activity of a user who uses the DVWA feature
2. Log that have been strung together with sqlmap attacks (i.e. variations of automated sql injection attacks),
Both logs are normalized to be neat, and easy to put into machine learning (naive bayes, svm),
then results in how accurately machine learning can distinguish true and false positives.
